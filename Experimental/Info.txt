This map contains experimental functions that are not used by the main methods.
Most of them are alternatives to functions that are used in the main methods.
- FSTDX: Choses fibers at random
- FSTDY: Choses fibers based on the relative approximation error.
- FSTDZ: Choses fibers based on the distribution proportional to the relative apprximation error.
- ParCubeX: Choses indices at random.
- ParCubenn: Uses a non-negative CP decomposition.
- ParCubennX: Uses an approximation of the non-negative CP decomposition in which only the first mode is decomposed by useing a non-negative matrix factorization.
- MACH_HOSVDnn: Uses a non-negative Tucker decomposition
